Kivy is an opensource  Python library that allows you to develop multi-platform graphical user interface applications on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Raspberry-Pi. In addition to regular mouse and keyboard inputs, it supports multitouch events. 
Applications made using Kivy will appear similar across all the platforms but it also means that the applications feel or look will differ from any native application.
